Probably backwards compatible:

* refine threading algorithm to pull out all sections in one query,
  parent-child relationships in a second query, then sort into threads
  without incurring more db hits. should be fast. will still want to
  cache some though.
* implement insert_child
* implement named url, reverse() stuff
* include base menu template
* menu templatetag?
* auto slugify for edits


Non-backwards compatible:

* replace 'ordinality' fields with django's built-in
  order_with_respect_to stuff
* connect Hierarchy with django sites framework for easy farming
